<p>a) train more computers to teach themselves by sifting through massive amounts of data coming out of all sorts of places</p>
<p>b) make these computers available through an API to provide a high-quality answer to anyone who is in need.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Is this group right for you?&nbsp; </b><b>Please READ below:</b></p>
<p><b>Defining business-to-business</b> (B2B):&nbsp; Refers to business that is conducted between companies, rather than between a company and individual consumers (B2C).&nbsp; <b>B2B Marketing</b> involves the sale of one company’s product or service to another company. B2B commerce transactions are between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or a technology company providing solutions to another company. </p>
<p><b>We are striving to build and maintain a substantive forum </b>on B2B Marketing and Communications within this group. <b>If you do not work in the B2B space, </b>as described above, we ask you,<b> please do not</b> request to join this group.</p>
<p><b>Business Marketing Association, Southern California Chapter (SoCal BMA)</b> provides a wide range of events, resources and opportunities to help B2B marketers meet the daily challenges of sustaining business profitability and enhancing their development as B2B marketing professionals. No other organization delivers the same level of commitment to the information and peer networking needs of business leaders, company marketers and communicators.</p>
<p>From executive round tables to panel discussions to online events, <b>SoCal BMA serves its B2B marketing community through</b> education, professional development, and peer networking. As a business marketer or communicator, your needs are distinct from those of the consumer marketing environment. SoCal BMA focuses on meeting the challenges presented in business marketing and communications, day in and day out.</p>
<p><b>Is this the right group for you?</b> <br>Defining business-to-business (B2B):&nbsp; Commerce transactions between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler. <br> <br><b>What this group is not about:</b> <br>This Los Angeles B2B Marketing Meetup Group is not intended for consumer products/services professionals such as financial planners, personal/auto insurance sales/consulting -- nor direct sales professionals (multi-level, network marketing). We are confident that you will find a number of <b>other Meetup Groups that can better facilitate those </b>specific interests and business needs. <br> <br><b>Who should join this group?</b> <br>B2B marketers and communicators. <br> <br><b>We hope the above information </b>has been helpful for you at determining if this group is <b>or is not</b> the right group for you. <br> </p>
